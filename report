Problem: 1
The table below gives the yield per hectare of the certain variety of paddy in a particular type of soil treated with manures A,B, and C. Analyse the results for manure test.
A	49	50	48	49
B	48	48	49	47
C	50	50	51	49


SOLUTION:
AIM: To test whether each of the factors independently affect the growth of paddy and there is a combined effect soil type and manure by using R software.
PROCEDURE:
STEP 1:  Setting the hypothesis 
                H0 : There is no significance difference between the type of the manure used.
                H1 : There is significance difference between the type of the manure used.
STEP 2:  Click R console window.
STEP 3:  Enter the given using c() function.
STEP 4:  Perform ANOVA test by aov() R command.
STEP 5:  Then the results will be displayed in the R console window
R INPUT:
> manure<-c(49,50,48,49,48,48,49,47,50,50,51,49)
> Soiltype<-c(rep("A",4),rep("B",4),rep("C",4))
> effect<-data.frame(manure,Soiltype)
>  results<-aov(manure~Soiltype,data=effect)
>  results
summary(results)

R OUTPUT:
 
RESULT:  Since p value equal to 0.0221 which is lesser than 0.05
(p > α), null hypothesis is not accepted at 5% level of significance.
INFERENCE:  From the result, we conclude that there is significance difference between the type of manure used towards plants.


PROBLEM 2:-
Fit a suitable regression model for the following data.
X	62	64	65	69	70	71	72	74
Y	126	125	139	145	165	152	180	208

AIM:
To fit a suitable regression model for the given data. 
PROCEDURE:
STEP 1:  Setting the hypothesis 
              Ho:  The fitted model is not significant.
              H1:  The fitted model is significant.
TEP 2:  Click R console window.
STEP 3:  Enter the given using c() function.
STEP 4:  Use R code lm() for fitting regression model.
STEP 5: Find out summary of model using the function summary().
STEP 6:  Then the results will be displayed in the R console window

R INPUT:
> X<-c(62,64,65,69,70,71,72,74)
> Y<-c(126,125,139,145,165,152,180,208)
> xy<-data.frame(x,y)
>xy
>plot(x,y,main=”scatter plot”)
>cor.test(x,y)
>regmodel<-lm(x,y)
>summary(regmodel)
R OUTPUT:
 
RESULT:
1. From the scatter plot, we can conclude that X and Y had a linear relationship.
2. The best fitted simple linear Regression model is Y=6.046X-258.373.
3. 95% variations in Y are explained by the variable X.
4. Since p<0.05 (0.002107< 0.05) at 5% level, we reject H0.


INFERENCE:
From the result, we can conclude that the fitted regression model is significant
